Time-series forecasting: Using 2 approaches: 
* 1) Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
* 2) Prophet (The Facebook's additive reggresion model).

The first approach (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) used in the field of deep learning for time-series forecasting due to its capacity to store information over a given period of time.

On the other hand, the Facebook's model: Prophet was made in an attempt to develop a model that could capture seasonality in time-series data. Its able to capture daily, weekly and yearly seasonality along with holiday effects, by implementing additive regression models.
